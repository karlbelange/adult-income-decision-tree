# adult-income-decision-tree
In this project, I used the UCI Adult Income dataset to predict whether individuals earn over $50K a year. The dataset had several real-world issues like missing values, categorical columns, unscaled data, and class imbalance. I cleaned and preprocessed the data, handled missing and categorical values, scaled numerical features, and addressed class imbalance to get it ready for machine learning.

I trained a Decision Tree classifier and evaluated its performance. This helped ensure the model was tested fairly across different splits of the data. The project focused on how solid preprocessing and the right validation strategy can improve the performance of a single, interpretable model like a decision tree.
